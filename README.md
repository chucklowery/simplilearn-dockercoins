# Simplilearn Dockercoins

[![Build & Test](https://github.com/chucklowery/simplilearn-dockercoins/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg?branch=docker)](https://github.com/chucklowery/simplilearn-dockercoins/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

A set of applications to demonstrate microservices interacting within a docker enviroment.

### Differences between main and Docker branches
 - Listening ports of applications switched from 80 to 8080; moved from reserved ports to user accessible ports
 - Docker files installed into each service directory; docker files describe the enviroments for each microservice
   - worker
   - hasher
   - rng
   - webui
 - A workflow is setup in .github/workflows describes how to test the system
 - A script to setup all services is provided in script/enviroment.sh this scripted is used in both the actions workflow and can be used in the learning enviroment to setup a single host enviorment with all services

### Application Architecture
The services provides are written in Python, Ruby, and Javascript (nodejs). Each application has a different set of needs for its enviroment. Each Docker file descripts those needs. 

#### Worker
The worker Service is responsible for talking with the RNG node, the Hasher Node, and the Redis Database. It is responsible for determining if the hashes generated by the Hasher Service based on the seeds provided by the RNG service should be stored in Redis. If they are acceptable it stores the Hash "coin."

##### Needs
- Python Enviroment (python:alpine)
- Python Library: "requests" (HTTP Library)
- Python Library: "redis" (redis driver Library)
##### Entrypoint
worker.py

#### Hasher
The Hasher Service is responsible for taking in a seed and converting that seed into a hash. The service is written in Ruby.

##### Needs
- Ruby Enviroment (ruby:alpine)
- System Library: build-base (needed to build Ruby Libraries)
- Ruby Gem: "sinatra" (Webserver Library; requires thins as a dependancy)
- Ruby Gem: "thin" (Webserver Library)
##### Entrypoint
- hasher.rb

#### RNG
The RNG Service is responsible for generating a random number for every request. It is written in Python and uses Flask as its webserver.
##### Needs
- Python Enviroment (python:alpine)
- Python Library: "flask" (Webserver Library)
##### Entrypoint
rng.py

#### WebUI
The WebUI Service is responsible for generating a user interface and http endpoints to provide that interface with data. The WebUI service is written in Javascript.
##### Needs
- NodeJS Enviroment (node:4-slim)
- Node Library: "express" (Webserver Library)
- Node Library: "redis" (redis driver Library)
##### Entrypoint
webui.js
